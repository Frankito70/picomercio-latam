## 🔄 Transaction states

- `pending`: waiting for confirmations
- `validating`: AI is processing
- `released`: payment sent to seller
- `in_dispute`: delayed delivery or mismatch
- `cancelled`: transaction aborted

---

## 🧠 AI Evaluation

AIGen logic:
- Both parties confirm → ✅ Release payment
- Seller confirms, buyer delays → ⚠️ Flag dispute after X days

---

## 💸 Payment release

Uses `createPayment()` from Pi SDK:

```js
window.PiNetwork.createPayment({
  amount: amount,
  memo: "Payment released by LATAM PiComercio",
  metadata: { type: "escrow_release", transaccion_id }
}, callback);
